## Description
In the USA, Canada, Australia and several European countries, the 1-year patient survival rate ranges from 98% to 99%, while the 1-year graft survival rate ranges from 95% to 98%.5 However, these figures may not accurately reflect the survival rates of KT recipients in developing countries.The lack of
transplant centres, strict organ donor policies and economic deprivation may all contribute to poor KT outcomes in developing countries. In Indonesia, the 1-year patient and allcause graft survival rates are 87% and 82.6%,respectively[1,2]. In this research we considered 5 important factors in the rate of death after the kidney transplantation. These parameters are diabete, BMI, smoking, and type of dialysis. At last we recognized that among these parameters, overweight might be mentnithind as one of the important factors.
